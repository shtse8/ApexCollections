High-performance, immutable collections for Dart, designed to be intuitive and integrate seamlessly with the Dart ecosystem.

## Core Goal

ApexCollections aims to be the premier immutable collection library for Dart, surpassing existing solutions like `fast_immutable_collections` in both performance and developer experience. It provides the safety of immutability with performance that meets or exceeds alternatives, feeling like a natural extension of the Dart language.

## Key Features

*   **Performance-Optimized:** Built using efficient persistent data structures (CHAMP Tries for Maps, RRB-Trees for Lists) for optimal speed across common operations.
*   **Immutable Guarantees:** All operations return new collection instances, ensuring predictable state management.
*   **Dart-Idiomatic API:** Designed to feel familiar and integrate smoothly with native Dart collections (`List`, `Map`, `Iterable`).
*   **Type Safe:** Leverages Dart's strong type system.
*   **Current Collections:**
    *   `ApexList<E>`: An immutable list implementation.
    *   `ApexMap<K, V>`: An immutable map implementation.

## Status

This library is currently under **active development**.

*   Core implementations for `ApexList` and `ApexMap` are complete.
*   Extensive unit tests are in place (`ApexMap` tests passing).
*   Ongoing work includes:
    *   Debugging and refining the `ApexList` implementation (specifically rebalancing logic).
    *   Performance benchmarking and optimization.
    *   Improving documentation.

## Performance (Baseline Comparison)

Initial benchmarks (comparing native Dart collections and `fast_immutable_collections` (FIC) with 10,000 elements) provide a baseline for `ApexCollections` goals.

**Key Observations (vs. FIC):**

*   **Lookups (`[]`):** Both native and FIC are very fast. `ApexCollections` aims to match this.
*   **Adds:** Native mutable adds are fastest. FIC adds involve overhead. `ApexCollections` aims for competitive immutable add performance.
*   **Removals:** Performance varies. `ApexCollections` aims for efficient immutable removals.
*   **Iteration:** Native iteration is generally faster. `ApexCollections` aims for efficient iteration.

*(Note: These are baseline results. Detailed benchmarks comparing ApexCollections against native and FIC are in progress and will be added once the library stabilizes. See the `benchmark/` directory for testing code.)*


## Installation

This package is not yet published on `pub.dev`. Once published, add it to your `pubspec.yaml`:

```yaml
dependencies:
  apex_collections: ^latest # Replace with actual version
```

Then run `dart pub get` or `flutter pub get`.

## Basic Usage

```dart
import 'package:apex_collections/apex_collections.dart';

void main() {
  // ApexList
  var list1 = ApexList<int>.empty();
  var list2 = list1.add(1).addAll([2, 3]);
  print(list2); // Output: ApexList<int>[1, 2, 3]
  print(list2[1]); // Output: 2

  // ApexMap
  var map1 = ApexMap<String, int>.empty();
  var map2 = map1.add('a', 1).addAll({'b': 2, 'c': 3});
  print(map2); // Output: ApexMap<String, int>{a: 1, b: 2, c: 3}
  print(map2['b']); // Output: 2
}
```
