# Active Context: ApexCollections

## Current Status (Timestamp: 2025-04-03 ~02:33 UTC+1)

-   Project initialized: `ApexCollections` directory created.
-   Initial Memory Bank structure established:
    -   `projectbrief.md`
    -   `productContext.md`
    -   `systemPatterns.md`
    -   `techContext.md`
    -   `activeContext.md` (this file)
    -   `progress.md` (to be created next)
-   High-level phased plan defined (see `projectbrief.md`).

## Current Focus

-   Completing the initial setup of the Memory Bank.
-   Preparing to start **Phase 1: Research & Benchmarking**.

## Next Immediate Steps

1.  Create the initial `progress.md` file.
2.  Define the specific research tasks and benchmark scenarios for Phase 1.
3.  Set up the basic Dart package structure within the `ApexCollections` directory (`pubspec.yaml`, `lib/`, `test/`, `benchmark/`).

## Open Questions / Decisions

-   Finalize the specific data structures to investigate in Phase 1 (e.g., RRB-Trees, CHAMP Tries).
-   Detail the exact benchmark operations, collection sizes, and data patterns to test.
