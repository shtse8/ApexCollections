## Current Status (Timestamp: 2025-04-03 ~03:05 UTC+1)

-   Project initialized, Memory Bank established.
-   Phase 1 Plan defined (`phase1-plan.md`).
-   Baseline benchmarks run and documented (`baseline-benchmarks.md`).
-   Initial research summaries for RRB-Trees and CHAMP Tries documented (`research-notes.md`).
-   `const` feasibility assessed as positive for both structures.
-   Benchmark suite refined with additional operations (`list_benchmarks.dart`, `map_benchmarks.dart`).
-   All changes committed and pushed.

## Current Focus

-   **Phase 1: In-depth Research - RRB-Trees & CHAMP Tries**

## Next Immediate Steps

1.  **Study Primary Sources:** Analyze the detailed algorithms and structures presented in the primary research papers/theses for RRB-Trees (Bagwell/Rompf) and CHAMP Tries (Steindorfer). This is required before implementation can begin.
2.  **Summarize Findings:** Document the detailed algorithms and implementation considerations in `research-notes.md`.
3.  **Go/No-Go Decision:** Based on the detailed research, confirm the decision to proceed with RRB-Trees and CHAMP Tries for the initial implementation.

## Open Questions / Decisions

-   Precise implementation details/algorithms for RRB-Tree and CHAMP operations in Dart.
-   Strategies for seamless `Iterable` integration based on detailed structure understanding.
