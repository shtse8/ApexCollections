# Progress: ApexCollections

## Current Status (Timestamp: 2025-04-04 ~07:07 UTC+1)

**Phase 1: Research & Benchmarking COMPLETE.** Foundational research conducted, data structures selected (RRB-Trees, CHAMP Tries), baseline benchmarks established.
**Phase 2: Core Design & API Definition COMPLETE.** Public APIs for `ApexList` and `ApexMap` defined. Core node structure files outlined. Basic implementation classes created. `toMap` added to `ApexMap`.
**Phase 3: Implementation & Unit Testing COMPLETE** (Excluding deferred `removeAt` debugging). Core logic for `ApexListImpl` and `ApexMapImpl` implemented and unit tested. Transient logic refined. `toMap` implemented in `ApexMapImpl`.
**Phase 4: Refactoring & Debugging COMPLETE** (for now - transient rebalance optimization pending). File writing issues resolved. Map test failures fixed (`ApexMap` tests pass). `ApexList` immutable and transient (merge/steal) rebalancing bugs fixed. Utilities extracted. Node structures refactored. Rebalancing helpers implemented.
**Phase 4: Performance Optimization & Benchmarking IN PROGRESS.** `ApexList` benchmarked after fixes. `ApexMap` needs benchmarking. Key optimization targets identified for `ApexList` (`addAll`/`fromIterable`, `lookup[]`).

## What Works

-   Project directory structure created and Git repository initialized.
-   Core Memory Bank files established and updated.
-   Basic Dart package structure confirmed (`pubspec.yaml`, etc.).
-   Public API definitions for `ApexList` (`lib/src/list/apex_list_api.dart`) and `ApexMap` (`lib/src/map/apex_map_api.dart`).
-   Node structures implemented for RRB-Trees (`lib/src/list/rrb_node.dart`) and CHAMP Tries (`lib/src/map/champ_node.dart`), including transient mutation logic. **(Refactored)**
-   `ApexMapImpl` methods implemented, using transient operations for bulk methods. `fromMap` uses efficient O(N) recursive bulk loading. Shows strong performance for modifications/iteration and `toMap`.
-   `ApexListImpl` methods implemented. `addAll` uses transient logic. `operator+` uses efficient O(log N) concatenation. `removeWhere` reverted to immutable filter. `sublist` uses efficient O(log N) tree slicing. `toList` refactored to use iterator. **(Refactored - utils extracted)**
-   Efficient iterators implemented for `ApexMapImpl` (`lib/src/map/champ_iterator.dart`) and `ApexListImpl` (`_RrbTreeIterator`). **(Map iterator extracted)**
-   Unit tests added and improved for `ApexMap` and `ApexList` core methods, iterators, equality, hash codes, and edge cases. **All `ApexMap` and `ApexList` tests pass.**
-   Benchmark suite created (`benchmark/`) comparing `ApexList`/`ApexMap` against native and FIC collections. Conversion benchmarks added. **`ApexList` benchmarks run after rebalancing fixes.**

## What's Left to Build (High-Level)

-   **Phase 1:** Research & Benchmarking **(DONE)**
-   **Phase 2:** Core Design & API Definition **(DONE)**
-   **Phase 3:** Implementation & Unit Testing **(DONE - Known Issue Deferred)**
-   **Phase 4:** Refactoring & Debugging **(COMPLETE - Core bugs fixed)**
-   **Phase 4:** Performance Optimization & Benchmarking **(IN PROGRESS - `ApexList` transient rebalance, `addAll`/`fromIterable`, `lookup[]`; `ApexMap` benchmarking)**
-   **Phase 5:** Documentation & Examples (GitHub Pages, `dart doc`).
-   **Phase 6:** CI/CD & Publishing (`pub.dev`).

## Known Issues / Blockers

-   **(Resolved)** List Test Runtime Error: The `StateError` in `RrbInternalNode._rebalanceOrMerge` (immutable path) was fixed.
-   **(Needs Benchmarking)** `ApexMap.fromMap` performance optimization needs verification via benchmarks.
-   **(Needs Optimization & Benchmarking)** `ApexList.fromIterable` / `addAll` performance is significantly slower than FIC. Requires optimizing the transient rebalancing path (plan-based case) and potentially bulk loading strategy. **(High Priority)**
-   **(Needs Optimization & Benchmarking)** `ApexList.lookup[]` performance is slower than FIC/Native.
-   **(Needs Benchmarking)** `ApexList.toList` performance improvement from iterator refactor needs verification via benchmarks (currently competitive).
-   `ApexMap` single `add`/`lookup` performance is acceptable but slower than competitors (lower priority).
-   **(Known Issue / Optimization Target)** The transient path for plan-based rebalancing in `_rebalanceOrMerge` currently creates new nodes instead of mutating in place. **(High Priority Optimization)**

## Next Milestones (Reflecting Active Context)

 4.  **(TODO / Medium Priority)** **Optimize `ApexList.fromIterable` / `addAll`:** Revisit bulk loading strategy alongside transient optimizations.
 5.  **(TODO / Medium Priority)** **Optimize `ApexList.lookup[]`:** Investigate tree traversal/indexing logic.
 6.  **(TODO / Medium Priority)** **Benchmark `ApexList`:** Re-run after optimizations.
 7.  **(TODO / Lower Priority)** **Benchmark `ApexMap`:** Run benchmarks for existing map implementation.
