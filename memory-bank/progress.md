# Progress: ApexCollections

## Current Status (Timestamp: 2025-04-03 ~13:21 UTC+1)

**Phase 1: Research & Benchmarking COMPLETE.** Foundational research conducted, data structures selected (RRB-Trees, CHAMP Tries), baseline benchmarks established.
**Phase 2: Core Design & API Definition COMPLETE.** Public APIs for `ApexList` and `ApexMap` defined. Core node structure files outlined. Basic implementation classes created.
**Phase 3: Implementation & Unit Testing COMPLETE** (Excluding deferred `removeAt` debugging). Core logic for `ApexListImpl` and `ApexMapImpl` implemented and unit tested. Transient logic refined.
**Phase 4: Performance Optimization & Benchmarking IN PROGRESS.** Initial benchmarks run, `ApexList.addAll` optimized.

## What Works

-   Project directory structure created and Git repository initialized.
-   Core Memory Bank files established and updated.
-   Basic Dart package structure confirmed (`pubspec.yaml`, etc.).
-   Public API definitions for `ApexList` (`lib/src/list/apex_list_api.dart`) and `ApexMap` (`lib/src/map/apex_map_api.dart`).
-   Node structures implemented for RRB-Trees (`lib/src/list/rrb_node.dart`) and CHAMP Tries (`lib/src/map/champ_node.dart`), including transient mutation logic.
-   `ApexMapImpl` methods implemented, using transient operations for bulk methods. Shows strong performance for modifications/iteration.
-   `ApexListImpl` methods implemented using node operations or standard patterns. `addAll` optimized with transient logic. `operator+` reverted to iterate/rebuild. Shows good performance for single operations.
-   Efficient iterators implemented for `ApexMapImpl` (`_ChampTrieIterator`) and `ApexListImpl` (`_RrbTreeIterator`).
-   Unit tests added and improved for `ApexMap` and `ApexList` core methods, iterators, equality, hash codes, and edge cases.
-   Benchmark suite created (`benchmark/`) comparing `ApexList`/`ApexMap` against native and FIC collections. Initial results gathered.

## What's Left to Build (High-Level)

-   **Phase 1:** Research & Benchmarking **(DONE)**
-   **Phase 2:** Core Design & API Definition **(DONE)**
-   **Phase 3:** Implementation & Unit Testing **(DONE - Known Issue Deferred)**
-   **Phase 4:** Performance Optimization & Benchmarking **(IN PROGRESS)**
-   **Phase 5:** Documentation & Examples (GitHub Pages, `dart doc`).
-   **Phase 6:** CI/CD & Publishing (`pub.dev`).

## Known Issues / Blockers

-   RRB-Tree rebalancing/merging logic in `RrbInternalNode.removeAt` appears mostly correct, but a test case involving many removals (`removeAt causes node merges/rebalancing`) fails with an assertion in `RrbLeafNode.removeAt`, indicating an invalid index is passed down during complex rebalancing scenarios. The exact interaction causing this needs further investigation. **(Deferred)**
-   `ApexList` iteration performance (`_RrbTreeIterator`) is significantly slower than native List and FIC IList.
-   `ApexList` `sublist` and `concat(+)` performance can be improved via node-level optimizations.

## Next Milestones (Phase 4 Continuation)

1.  **(Deferred) Debug RRB-Tree `removeAt` Rebalancing:** Investigate the assertion failure.
2.  **Investigate `ApexList` Iterator Performance:** Analyze `_RrbTreeIterator` implementation for bottlenecks.
3.  **Optimize `ApexList` Bulk Operations (Post-Iterator Fix):** Revisit `sublist`, `operator+` for node-level optimizations. Consider transient builder.
4.  **Re-run Benchmarks:** After optimizations, re-run benchmarks.
5.  **Begin Documentation:** Start writing basic API documentation.
