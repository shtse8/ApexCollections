# Progress: ApexCollections

## Current Status (Timestamp: 2025-04-04 ~19:30 UTC+1)

**Phase 1: Research & Benchmarking COMPLETE.** Foundational research conducted, data structures selected (RRB-Trees, CHAMP Tries), baseline benchmarks established.
**Phase 2: Core Design & API Definition COMPLETE.** Public APIs for `ApexList` and `ApexMap` defined. Core node structure files outlined. Basic implementation classes created. `toMap` added to `ApexMap`.
**Phase 3: Implementation & Unit Testing COMPLETE** (Excluding deferred `removeAt` debugging). Core logic for `ApexListImpl` and `ApexMapImpl` implemented and unit tested. Transient logic refined. `toMap` implemented in `ApexMapImpl`.
**Phase 4: Refactoring & Debugging COMPLETE.** File writing issues resolved. Map test failures fixed (`ApexMap` tests pass). `ApexList` immutable and transient rebalancing bugs fixed. Utilities extracted. Node structures refactored (`champ_node.dart` structure fixed, including adding missing `ChampArrayNode`). Rebalancing helpers implemented. Persistent analyzer errors resolved.
**Phase 4: Performance Optimization & Benchmarking COMPLETE (for now).** `ApexList` performance stable with minor improvements after map node fixes. `ApexMap` iteration and `toMap` performance dramatically improved after fixing `champ_node.dart` structure. `ApexMap.add` also improved. Other `ApexMap` single-op performance stable but still slower than competitors. Further optimization deferred.

## What Works

-   Project directory structure created and Git repository initialized.
-   Core Memory Bank files established and updated.
-   Basic Dart package structure confirmed (`pubspec.yaml`, etc.).
-   Public API definitions for `ApexList` (`lib/src/list/apex_list_api.dart`) and `ApexMap` (`lib/src/map/apex_map_api.dart`).
-   Node structures implemented for RRB-Trees (`lib/src/list/rrb_node.dart`) and CHAMP Tries (`lib/src/map/champ_node.dart`), including transient mutation logic. **(Refactored & Fixed `champ_node.dart` structure)**
-   `ApexMapImpl` methods implemented. `addAll` shows excellent performance. Iteration and `toMap` performance significantly improved after node fixes. `add`/`update`/`remove` performance acceptable but slower than competitors. `fromMap` remains slow.
-   `ApexListImpl` methods implemented. `addAll` optimized using concatenation strategy. `fromIterable` uses recursive concatenation strategy. `operator+` uses efficient O(log N) concatenation. `removeWhere` reverted to immutable filter. `sublist` uses efficient O(log N) tree slicing. `toList` refactored to use iterator. **(Refactored - utils extracted, `addAll` optimized, `fromIterable` strategy changed)**
-   Efficient iterators implemented for `ApexMapImpl` (`lib/src/map/champ_iterator.dart`) and `ApexListImpl` (`_RrbTreeIterator`). **(Map iterator extracted)**
-   Unit tests added and improved for `ApexMap` and `ApexList` core methods, iterators, equality, hash codes, and edge cases. **All `ApexMap` and `ApexList` tests pass.**
-   Benchmark suite created (`benchmark/`) comparing `ApexList`/`ApexMap` against native and FIC collections. Conversion benchmarks added. **Benchmarks re-run after `champ_node.dart` fixes.**

## What's Left to Build (High-Level)

-   **Phase 1:** Research & Benchmarking **(DONE)**
-   **Phase 2:** Core Design & API Definition **(DONE)**
-   **Phase 3:** Implementation & Unit Testing **(DONE - Known Issue Deferred)**
-   **Phase 4:** Refactoring & Debugging **(COMPLETE - Core bugs fixed, `champ_node.dart` structure fixed, analyzer issues resolved)**
-   **Phase 4:** Performance Optimization & Benchmarking **(COMPLETE - Significant `ApexMap` iteration improvement observed, further optimization deferred)**
-   **Phase 5:** Documentation & Examples (GitHub Pages, `dart doc`). **(Current Phase)**
-   **Phase 6:** CI/CD & Publishing (`pub.dev`).

## Known Issues / Blockers

-   **(Resolved)** List Test Runtime Error: The `StateError` in `RrbInternalNode._rebalanceOrMerge` was fixed.
-   **(Resolved)** `champ_node.dart` structural errors and missing `ChampArrayNode` definition fixed.
-   **(Resolved)** Persistent Dart Analyzer errors resolved.
-   **(Needs Optimization - Deferred)** `ApexMap.fromMap` performance (~8334us) is significantly slower than FIC. Optimization attempts reverted.
-   **(Strategy Stable)** `ApexList.fromIterable` uses recursive concatenation. Build time (~2858us) slightly improved, still slower than FIC but accepted trade-off for lookup/sublist gains.
-   **(Improved)** `ApexList.addAll` performance stable and excellent (~29us).
-   **(Stable)** `ApexList.lookup[]` performance stable and excellent (~0.15us).
-   **(Improved)** `ApexList.sublist` performance stable and excellent (~5.65us).
-   **(Stable)** `ApexList.toList` performance stable and competitive (~716us).
-   **(Improved but Deferred)** `ApexMap` single `add` (~4.08us) improved but still slower than Native/FIC. `lookup` (~0.24us), `remove` (~3.73us), `update` (~8.47us) stable but slower than Native/FIC for lookup. Further optimization deferred.
-   **(Massively Improved!)** `ApexMap` `iterateEntries` (~25us) and `toMap` (~52us) performance dramatically improved after fixing `champ_node.dart`, now significantly faster than Native/FIC.
-   **(Resolved)** The transient path for plan-based rebalancing in `_rebalanceOrMerge` now mutates nodes in place via `_executeTransientRebalancePlan`.
