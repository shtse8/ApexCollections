# Progress: ApexCollections

## Current Status (Timestamp: 2025-04-03 ~04:05 UTC+1)

**Phase 1: Research & Benchmarking COMPLETE.** Foundational research conducted, data structures selected (RRB-Trees, CHAMP Tries), baseline benchmarks established, and benchmark suite refined.
**Phase 2: Core Design & API Definition IN PROGRESS.** Public APIs for `ApexList` and `ApexMap` defined. Core node structure files outlined.

## What Works

-   Project directory structure created and Git repository initialized.
-   Core Memory Bank files established and updated through Phase 1 & start of Phase 2.
-   Basic Dart package structure confirmed (`pubspec.yaml`, etc.).
-   Baseline benchmark suite for native and FIC collections is functional.
-   Public API definitions for `ApexList` (`lib/src/list/apex_list_api.dart`) and `ApexMap` (`lib/src/map/apex_map_api.dart`).
-   Basic node structure outlines for RRB-Trees (`lib/src/list/rrb_node.dart`) and CHAMP Tries (`lib/src/map/champ_node.dart`).

## What's Left to Build (High-Level)

-   **Phase 1:** Research & Benchmarking **(DONE)**
-   **Phase 2:** Core Design & API Definition **(IN PROGRESS - APIs Defined, Structure Outlined)**
-   **Phase 3:** Implementation & Unit Testing (Core logic). **(NEXT)**
-   **Phase 4:** Performance Optimization & Benchmarking (Refinement).
-   **Phase 5:** Documentation & Examples (GitHub Pages, `dart doc`).
-   **Phase 6:** CI/CD & Publishing (`pub.dev`).

## Known Issues / Blockers

-   `ApexListImpl` and `ApexMapImpl` need to implement the methods defined in their respective API files. (Expected at this stage).
-   Helper methods within `champ_node.dart` require correct index math and bitpos context (Marked as TODOs).

## Next Milestones (Phase 3 Start)

1.  Begin implementing core RRB-Tree node logic (`lib/src/list/rrb_node.dart`) based on research notes and API requirements (add, update, get, removeAt).
2.  Begin implementing core CHAMP Trie node logic (`lib/src/map/champ_node.dart`) based on research notes and API requirements (add, get, remove), including fixing helper methods.
3.  Start implementing the concrete `ApexListImpl` class (`lib/src/list/apex_list.dart`) using the RRB-Tree nodes.
4.  Start implementing the concrete `ApexMapImpl` class (`lib/src/map/apex_map.dart`) using the CHAMP Trie nodes.
5.  Begin writing unit tests for the core node operations and initial list/map methods.
